Mazza, few things:
1. The package has moved to git/IPU_ROS. so use that.
2. Didn't have the time to make for eclipse.. so you'll have to be hardcore and use sublime text.. 
3.0. To run the python tester:
3.1. >cd ROS_Python
3.2. >python sender.py
3.3. you can see it the other tab here. lines 17, 24 will print the message itself.
3.4. Run it only after running roscore and running the server.
4. I left 4 terminals open:
a|b
c|d
a = python tester
b = our server
c = roscore
d = camera driver

Use them wisely.
If you want to check out your filter with the python tester (which is a good idea) 
I added comments for you to understand and add your implementation. Its pretty easy
